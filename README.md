Hello!  My name is Charles, and I am *relatively* new to all of this.  After about 18-months, however, I've discovered that one thing I'm not so great at is the physical/pracitcal aspect of this, but I am VERY good at the conceptual ideas.  So, instead of becoming a software developer, I'm now a writer and editor for twi different cybersecurity companies.
